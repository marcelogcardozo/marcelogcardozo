Building scalable products at the intersection of software, data and finance.

Software Engineer with a strong background in quantitative finance and data engineering.  
I design and ship end-to-end systems, from APIs and pipelines to full platforms in production, turning complex problems into simple, usable software.

Focused on real-world impact, clean architecture, and products that actually run.
